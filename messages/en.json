    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How to find birthday from NIC number Sri Lanka?",
        "answer": "Enter your 9 or 12 digit NIC number in the decoder above. The tool extracts the encoded birth date: the first 2 digits (old format) or 4 digits (new format) represent your birth year, and the next 3 digits represent the day of the year you were born."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between old and new NIC format?",
        "answer": "The old NIC format has 9 digits plus a letter (V or X), while the new format has 12 digits only. The new format uses a 4-digit year instead of 2-digit, providing better year identification. Both formats encode birthday and gender information the same way."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to decode Sri Lankan NIC number?",
        "answer": "Our free online tool automatically decodes any Sri Lankan NIC number. Simply enter your NIC above to instantly see your birthday, gender, and calculated age. The decoding happens entirely in your browser for complete privacy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is NIC information extraction safe and private?",
        "answer": "Yes, 100% safe and private. Our tool processes your NIC number entirely in your browser (client-side). No data is sent to any server, stored, or logged. Your NIC information never leaves your device."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I decode a NIC number from any year?",
        "answer": "Yes, our tool supports NIC numbers from any year. Old format NICs work for birth years 1900-2099, while new format NICs support the full 4-digit year range."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the NIC number determine gender?",
        "answer": "The day of year digits (positions 3-5 in old format, 5-7 in new format) determine gender. Values 001-366 indicate male, while values 501-866 indicate female (500 is added to the actual day of year for females)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I entered my NIC but it shows invalid?",
        "answer": "Check that you've entered all digits correctly. Old format should be exactly 9 digits followed by V or X. New format should be exactly 12 digits. Make sure there are no spaces or special characters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this an official government tool?",
        "answer": "No, this is an independent educational tool. For official NIC services, please visit the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) of Sri Lanka."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this tool on mobile devices?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our tool is fully responsive and works perfectly on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The interface adapts to any screen size."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some NICs have V and others have X?",
        "answer": "In the old NIC format, V is the standard check letter. X is used when the serial number sequence for that day exceeds certain limits. Both are equally valid."
